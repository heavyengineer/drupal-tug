Registry and format agnostic JavaScript package manager.

* Supports installing any module format from any registry, with GitHub and npm currently provided, via [the registry API](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/wiki/Registry-API).
* Couples to the [SystemJS module loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs), which is built on the current draft of the [browser ES6 module loader](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader) specfication.
* Carefully resolves version ranges using greedy fork minimization into flat multi-version package folders.
* Provides tiered bundling of multi-format module trees using [SystemJS builder](https://github.com/systemjs/builder).
* Loads and builds assets through [SystemJS plugins](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs#plugins).
