# electron-download

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/electron-download.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/electron-download/)

downloads a electron release zip from github

used by [electron-prebuilt](https://npmjs.org/electron-prebuilt) and [electron-packager](https://npmjs.org/electron-packager)

### usage

```
var download = require('electron-download')

download({
  version: '0.25.1',
  arch: 'ia32',
  platform: 'win32'
}, function (err, zipPath) {
  // zipPath will be the path of the zip that it downloaded.
  // if the zip was already cached it will skip
  // downloading and call the cb with the cached zip path
  // if it wasn't cached it will download the zip and save
  // it in the cache path (~/.electron)
})
```

if you don't specify `arch` or `platform` args it will use `require('os')` to get them from the current OS. specifying `version` is mandatory.

You can set the `ELECTRON_MIRROR` env variable to use a custom base URL for grabbing electron zips.
